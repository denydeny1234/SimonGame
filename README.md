- The game consists of four colored buttons: red, green, blue, and yellow.
- Simon, the game, will start by playing a random sequence of colors by lighting up the corresponding buttons and producing a sound for each.
- Pay close attention to the sequence as you'll need to repeat it correctly.
- Once Simon finishes the sequence, it's your turn to repeat it by clicking on the buttons in the same order.
